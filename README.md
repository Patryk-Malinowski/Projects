Welcome to the Job Tracker, a Python project developed during my first year! This tool allows recruitment agencies to efficiently manage and analyze job listings. Here's a brief overview of its features:

## Features:

### 1. Job Management
- **Add Jobs:** Easily add job listings with detailed specifications.

### 2. Detailed Specifications

### 3. Analytics
- **Calculate Metrics:** Dynamically calculate the average hourly rate, hourly rate range, and retrieve details of the highest paying job.

### 4. Data Persistence
